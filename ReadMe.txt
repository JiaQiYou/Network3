I uploaded it many times, but at first I misunderstood the way to write a makefile. After several attempts, I finally got it right. At first, I thought it was caused by comments, but I forgot to read the error instructions in the makefile and thought it was a code issue. Later, I found out that the makefile I wrote was for compiling C++, but in fact, it should be for compiling C. This mistake is very foolish. I repeatedly corrected it more than ten times before discovering the problem.
